I wish to record my sorry affair. My son is living separately since his marriage from about 10 years. As of now we have blood relation only. I don`t know full details about his LOAN with some finance firm in your group. From some source Ur people gathered my contact no & called for his money .The much agony was called my wife when she was in a condolance. Is fair ? Think a while if this happen to any of Ur people.
Guys, please do not go for Bajaj Finance EMI card options. They say that you will receive your EMI card once you take a loan and pay the fourth instalment. When I asked for the status of the EMI card they reply this; "With reference to your mail we would like to inform you that due to some technical issue your card is not generated in our records .". On top of this they say to contact 020 - 3957 4151 for clarifications but its only an IVR. Every time I try to confirm when will this error be rectified, I get the same canned reply from the email support.Bajaj Finance just wants to pull people to get loans and then they will not provide you what they have promised. With so much documentation involved, its better to use credit cards instead. At least they provide you 0% interest.
I have purchased television from a bajaj finance & received EMI card also recently my loan is finished but no any NOC received yet from bajaj fineserv. What can I do ...?

Hi bajaj few days back i posted a complaintRegarding misbehaviour of your executive with my Mom And wifeTill now you i have not got any response from your endWhich shows you people are not taking this complain seriously
!!!! BEWARE !!!I am sorry to inform you that your executive has done a Signature Forgery of mine in Loan Detail Sheet. For your kind perusal the copy of the same has been attached with this mail. Provide me an honest feedback for the mentioned reason, why your employee has forged my signature and how come you people approved that without verifying the signature in your record. By doing the signature forgery of mine your employee has activated EXTENDED WARRANTY CD without my knowledge. What course of action has been initiated from your end?Next point for which I want a clear feedback or explanation. The point mentioned below-As per Guidelines-- A cancelled cheque is one which is crossed and the word "Cancelled" is written on it. Except this, nothing else needs to be written on the cheque. Then why you people force customer to do Signature on the cheque?While exercising the option to make payment through ECS, Destination Account Holder shall furnish the particulars of his / her / their (i) Account Number, (ii) Name / Nomenclature, (iii) Account Type (i.e. S.B. Account or Current Account) and (iv) Bank and branch names with the MICR sort-codes. The sort-code (i.e. city-bank-branch code) information would be available by seeing the MICR code line of the cheque book issued by the banker where the account is maintained. The form in which the information would be furnished by the Destination Account Holders would be clear and free of ambiguities. The particulars at Sl. Nos. (i) to (iv) mentioned above may be got certified by the beneficiary from the bank branch where the account is maintained. To make sure the authenticity of the bank details furnished, the banker must certify the correctness; verify the customerâ€™s signature by putting his / her own signature in the mandate.Information furnished by a beneficiary to the User shall not be utilized by the User for purposes other than transfer of funds through ECS without the consent of the beneficiaries. This shall be indicated by the User while inviting options from the beneficiaries.When the customer signs the ECS mandate Form then why unethically you people force customer to Sign on a cancel cheque? What is the actual motive behind the above mentioned reason?

Dear Bajaj Finserv Team,I am totally disappointed by your reply. I never expected such a false promise from your side. My father is such a old customer of your company. My father EMI card number is 2030-4000-0708-6319 (Harbir Singh Anand). My company employees are also using Bajaj finance EMI card. I have purchased the Laptop through Bajaj finance for getting EMI card facility. Now you are saying you are not able to process. This is not a good sign of Bajaj finserv company.Your agent has promised me to purchased laptop through Bajaj finserv and he has taken Rs 300 extra for making EMI card. He has taken Rs 750 for making file. I asked him for the receipt but he has not given any receipt for EMI card. He told me that only laptop purchased receipt would be issue. You can consult him. I consulted him last month and he has told me that he has submitted the request for EMI card and I will get it by December. Now when I am trying to contact him, I am getting switched off in his mobile. Your agent name is Sushil from Chandigarh branch office and his contact number is 9876188571.I am disheartened by your service. It is my request, kindly take strict action and issue my EMI card. My loan no is 424DPF13977833. You are spoiling the image of Bajaj finance and I am not going to be silent because your company has given false promise and you are not fulfilling the requirement after taking money. I have attached laptop purchased receipt which I got from the dealer of Dell company.If you are not going to take action and issue my EMI card then I need to go further because this is a breach of trust.I hope you will take action and come with positive response. Thanks for your kind cooperation.

Hi..this is regarding the transfer of my housing loan from ICICI to your institution. I have recently transferred my loan to bajaj finance. My LAN is 402SHL17119243. I had my loan transferred on the promise that I will be given a EMI holiday of 3 months which your team seems to have "forgotten" to put in the system. I have now received an EMI schedule without considering the EMI holiday. I am now fighting with the sales manager Mr. KUNAL who says he will have to try and see if he can make the changes and was trying to convince me on why I should now not go for it. When you use EMI holiday as a feature while selling, how can you now claim that it's a loss for me? I have mail trails of how I have needed to follow up with the team for everything and have not had a satisfactory experience. Now it looks like I'm trapped since I have already paid all the processing fees. Please get the EMI holiday issue resolved or I will have to make this message public so that others are not impacted like this. Regards,

Hello I have been waiting for my EMI card for four months but have not received it yet .
if bajaj finserv is attached to online shopping company like flipkart and snapdeal and other then it would be more better to purchased goods on loan through bajaj finserv
Please call me on 9872303897 as soon as possible else I need to contact consumer forum for your complaint.
Sir how can i get a bajaj finserv card plz help
my earlier post are also now deleted from here ...thank you guys u once again proved that i am not wrong
Your customer calls and asks me to make the payment online and rudely disconnects the call. Where else you have already sent a confirmation message of auto debit with the new account number. Can someone take care of this and call
i am expecting u guys will reply me soon
Today I was harassed by your collection guy named Imran.
This is to inform you that I had sufficient balance in my account to pay the EMI however ECS got return due without any reason. I contacted my bank and also downloaded the bank statement and saw that in both time money got debited and again credited back to my account whereas I had sufficient balance to pay the EMI. Today i received SMS to call for any 022 67080282/87 I called so many times but it always went engage however I got thorugh the call but the caller hung up the call up twice then. In the mean time a guy Named Imran called me with the following conversation " Bikram bol rahein ho? once i replied Yes teh nhe started like a recorded machine "Main Bajaj Finance se Bol raha hoon. App ne loan liya aur uska EMI bounce ho gaya on that I tried to clarified that ki mere account mein enough balance tha for bajaj EMI but ECS return kyoun hua? On this he bluntly told me that appkein bank ne hum ko kahan ki appkein account mein paise nahin hain iskein chaltein bank ne humein paisa nahin diya" Ha..ha..ha It was hilarious to hear but he just went On., stopping from me to speak. Asking question to clarify my doubt is my rights. To ask why my ECS got return as this hampered my account statement and also additional charges. he just told me he will call later in the evening and hung up. Then again I got a call from a lady within an hour and clearing the dues for which i tried to explain her, on which she said she can't give any feedback as they are from collection team which I can understand and also told her that in the morning I will make an online payment to pay the EMI and also told her to call me at 11am to get teh payment confirmation then she politely hung up the call. I was still expecting a call from bajaj on the issue which I raised but to my shock got a call from Imran with tone of a goon and threatening me that why didn't I paid the EMI after his call. I was trying to explain him that i already told one lady about payment will be done tomorrow morning as i am busy with some work. He again threatened me stating that he knows about the call and do whatever it doesn't matter to him if i complaint against him but pay the money today itself on which I disconnected the call. Very sad to see that being respected company how you recruit such an unethical guy who didn't even checked the track record of the customer before making call. I have attached my bank statement for your reference which shows that money got debited and then credited back. Payment will done tomorrow morning as promised. I request you that kindly take strict action against the said caller named Imran. I got a call from 022-41617500/022-41614203. I am also going to file an online complaint against the said person on National consumer forum if strict action not taken against him.

 Hi, I have finance a washing machine from â€ª#â€ŽBehlEnterprisesâ€¬ â€ª#â€ŽDehradunâ€¬. The model which I selected was different when delivered.

When I asked Bajaj representative to cancel my finance scheme he said â€ª#â€ŽBajajâ€¬ is not responsible as the file is send to HQs. This is your â€ª#â€Žcustomerserviceâ€¬?

  I purchased a mac mini from apple store Indore, I paid for bajaj card and paid as well. It's been almost 8 month but I didn't get my card yet.
  I am not sure, How to reach actual PEOPLE in Bajaj Finserv. As soon as I got a Personal Loan, the person who collected document is vanished. The person who was following from Call Center is nowhere. I tried calling Call Center, I bet if anybody ever come out of loop of 1k options to reach actual PERSON. Even though I got loan in time, there is no one who can solve my queries afterwards.I have raised a request in Support and from Bajaj Customer portal, they have not resolved queries.
  The SAME old story with BajaFInserve team. They are unable to process the ECS request and there executives continuously keep harassing. Very Very sad and putting off to work woth Baja FInance ever...

  Great service. after paying all emi's the person of contact will block your number and you will not your NOC back.Choose bajaj and be ready to meet rowdies at home for payment.My brother finished his payment a month back and still havent recieved the NOC. Now the person of contact disappeared.
